Nicer New Gmail Theme
=====================

This is a theme for the new (2018) Gmail theme to remove a lot of the
visual inconsistencies and overuse of whitespace, helping to create a
clean visual style that more closely mirrors the rest of Google's
product suite.

The theme comes in two forms:

* A [Stylish theme](https://userstyles.org/styles/159843/nicer-new-gmail)
  that you can apply in your browser, with customizable color options.

* A [Kiwi for Gmail](https://www.kiwiforgmail.com/) theme, which can be
  applied by generating and running a script (see the releases tab).


Generating the Theme
--------------------

To generate the theme, simply run:

    $ make

The Stylish theme and Kiwi script will be found in `dist/`.
